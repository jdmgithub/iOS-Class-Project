3.	Kindle
This is a simple e-book reader application that syncs nicely with existing amazon accounts.  Its general book navigation works well with good navigation and buttons.

There is limited text fields that are functional.  There are no in-app purchases.  

4.	Candy Crush Saga
Addictive game with vibrant colors and shapes that move, flow, fall and explode in an interesting fashion.  Much of the navigation within the gameplay is complemented with sound effects.  The images and text is clear and easy to read.  This adds to the enjoyment.  There is little use of text fields, but heavy use of in-app purchases.  

5.	LastPass
Simple password creation and secure storage app.  It performs well, with a good navigation flow.  It gets a bit busy by trying to expand its role into other functions like note taking.  The colors and navigation flow are functional, but not particularly interesting.  The text fields work well, many of which are auto-populated.  There are no in-app purchases.

7.	Plants vs Zombies 2
Highly polished, colorful interface and game design.  Its navigation and controls are too ambitious for a small screen.  The game becomes difficult to control and play due to the use of small icons and game controls.  The buttons and controls are easily readable, but too small.  The game and navigation flow is intuitive and well done.  It does have effective in-app purchases.

8.  Flashcards
FLashcard-based english and vocabulary testing.  The navigation is simple and effective by nearly operating without user input.

There is not a heavy use of text fields, but the sign-up and customization works well.  It does not have in-app purchases.  

9.  Epicurious 
Good use of images integrated into navigation buttons.  They are large, clear and easy to read.  The navigation flow is endless, left to right scrolling.  Integrating a vertical navigation flow and ending the endless horizontal scrolling would help in navigation.  The design and images make finding recipes easy.  While the text search box works, the design is intended emphasize manual scrolling and image pressing.  It does not have in-app purchases.  

10.  WebMD
Colors and buttons are clear and easily readable.  The size of buttons and text is relatively small.  The text search and sign-up works well, but can be tricky given the type of text being input (complex medical terms).  The browsing navigation helps find the relevant topics.  The overall design suffers from trying to do so much - drug information, symptom tracker, condition description, etc.  It loads slow and may be better served being divided into multiple apps. There is a large use of text on the app.  There are no in-app purchases.
